## Description
This is a C++ program called **changeOfBase.cpp** that converts an integer number from one base to another. The program asks the user for the current base, the number in that current base, and the new base to be converted to. Valid bases are between 2 and 36. Values of digits from 10 – 35 will be represented by characters A – Z. It is guaranteed that all values will be less than or equal to 2^(32) - 1.

The program can add/subtract to/from characters, for example 'a' + 1 is 'b' and 'B' + 2 is 'D'.

## Examples of the input and the program's output:

1.
```
Please enter the number's base: 10
Please enter the number: 25
Please enter the new base: 2
25 base 10 is 11001 base 2
```
2.	 
```
Please enter the number's base: 6
Please enter the number: 405
Please enter the new base: 19
405 base 6 is 7G base 19
```
3.	 
```
Please enter the number's base: 24
Please enter the number: GIG
Please enter the new base: 10
GIG base 24 is 9664 base 10
